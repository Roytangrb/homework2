          <p class="lead"><b>Authors may draw conclusions from data that are not fully supported by it. Their implication is that their conclusion naturally follows from the statistical evidence.</b> Again, this could be due to spinning or a misunderstanding of the limits or meaning of the statistics and the logical steps involved in their argument. “Places at UK medical schools have been cut by 10% so in a few years time there will be a shortage of NHS doctors”. This statement uses the statistic to present the conclusion as a fact. If one thinks logically about the statement it implies that the only factor that affects the supply of NHS doctors is UK medical school places and that demand for doctors will remain constant. In fact the supply of NHS doctors is affected by many more factors including foreign-trained doctors coming to the UK, the age profile and retirement rates of current doctors, the number leaving the profession (pre-retirement) or returning to it, drop-out rates at medical school, medical students training in the UK and working overseas, propensity to work in the private sector, changes in working hours, and so on.
          <br><br>
          The NHS is hiring thousands of doctors from overseas as it tries to tackle a growing staff shortage. </p>

          <p class="lead">While the anecdote is related to the phenomenon it is selected as an example of the most shocking or dramatic. The most extreme cases are normally the rarest. By linking the extent data to the extreme example the author could be attempting to get the reader to imagine that all the cases of this phenomenon are as extreme as the example given. In reality a large majority of the cases will be less extreme and dramatic than the example given. <br><br><span class="text-muted"><b>Regression to the mean</b></span><br>When an observation or result is particularly high compared to the mean we expect the next one to be lower (closer to the mean) and vice versa.This is known as regression to the mean. It does not always happen, but the most likely follow-up to an extreme outcome is a less extreme one simply because most outcomes are less extreme. Ignoring this effect means reading too much into the data by viewing random variation as real change.</p>

          <p class="lead">The box below illustrates an example where there has been no aggregate change in the mean, but variations show a strong indication of regression to the mean.</p>
          <article style="font-size: 16px">
            Primary school attainment tables measure, among other things, the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in English, maths and science. These percentages are added for each school and multiplied by 100 to give an aggregate score (out of 300). Nationally there was little change between the aggregate score between 2007 and 2009.
The charts opposite break schools down by 2007 aggregate score into twenty equal sized groups. The first chart looks at how the average performance changed for each group in 2008. Clearly the poorest performing schools in 2007 increased their aggregate score by most. This effect was smaller for each of the next ten groups. In all of the top prior performing ten groups average performance fell and it fell most for the best performing groups of schools. This strongly suggests regression to the mean. Results changed most where earlier results were most extreme. The next chart underlines this. It looks at the same groups of schools (2007 performance bands) and compares average change in results from 2008 to 2009. There is no clear pattern and average changes are small. There is still regression to the mean at an individual school level, but this is cancelled out for groups based on 2007 performance because these groups have already returned towards the mean.
Analysis of change in 2009 by 2008 performance bands shows a very similar pattern to that of the first chart. Regression to the mean occurs after extreme results and so is identifiable when results are organised that way. There are real differences between the performance of schools, but there is also substantial year to year variation in results which displays a clear element of random variation.
